# SE-Electronic-training-platform
Web-Based System, An electronic platform and a mobile phone application that aims to  provide services and training activities at the PoTHMs to everyone concerned with the two holy mosques.

* The term training platform means providing training courses for specific groups that are 
sponsored by an institution.
In the Kingdomâ€™s endeavor to provide the best services to the guests of the PoTHMs to 
perform the rituals with ease, Here comes the turn to POTHMs in helping Two Holy 
Mosques to contribute to achieving the goal of the Kingdom.
The General Statistics Authority indicates that the number of workers in THMs are more 
than 10,000 from different parts of the world, some of whom did not have how to guide 
people to their correct destination, so this platform came to train the trainers through remote 
training courses that teach them the most accurate details.
Through this pandemic, a lot of people who need to train they stop their training because of 
the distancing, this platform will help them to have a full knowledge in distance.
Therefore, we decided to build an ETP system to help PoTHMs workers to do their work 
in ease and a professional way at the same time
